The project already contains a logo at `logo.png`.

If you want alternate variants, add files here:
- `logo.svg` — scalable vector, preferred for crispness.
- `logo-light.png` — light-background/inverse version for dark themes.
- `logo-dark.png` — dark-background optimized version.

The site references `/assets/logo.png`. If you prefer a different filename, update the HTML accordingly or tell me and I'll update it.

Next steps I can take for you:
- Resize/optimise the current PNG and generate optimized web-friendly sizes.
- Create a monochrome / single-color version for minimal headers.
- Add an SVG decorative badge and place it in the header as an ornamental element.
